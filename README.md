**Project Status**: Completed as per given Figma design. Mobile and desktop layouts closely match the intended look. Instead of strict pixel-by-pixel replication, I implemented deliberate design adjustments during actual development to improve performance, maintain responsiveness, and optimize user experience. Some alignments and uniformity differ slightly from the Figma design as part of these adjustments. All images and texts are editable from the Shopify Customizer. Header and footer are based on Dawn theme styling with modifications to resemble the design. Since the custom template could not be properly previewed, both the homepage and the custom page template currently share the same look.
